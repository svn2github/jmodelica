    <title>Introduction to models</title>

    <para>Modelica and Optimica models can be compiled and loaded as model
    objects using the JModelica.org Python interface. These model objects can
    be used for both simulation and optimization purposes. This chapter will
    cover how to compile Modelica and Optimica models, set compiler options,
    load the compiled model in a Python model object and use the model object
    to perform model manipulations such as setting and getting
    parameters.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The different model objects in JModelica.org</title>

      <para>There are three different kinds of model objects that can be
      created with JModelica.org: <literal>FMUModel(ME/CS)1</literal>,
      <literal>JMUModel</literal> and <literal>CasadiModel</literal>. The
      <literal>FMUModel(ME/CS)1</literal> is created by loading an
      <emphasis>FMU</emphasis> (Functional Mock-up Unit), which is a
      compressed file compliant with the FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface)
      standard. The <literal>JMUModel</literal> is created by loading a
      <emphasis>JMU</emphasis>, which is a compressed file with a
      JModelica.org specific structure. The <literal>CasadiModel</literal> is
      created by loading an <emphasis>FMUX</emphasis> which is a compressed
      file containing the XML file needed to work with <link
      xlink:href="http://casadi.org">CasADI</link>.</para>

      <para>FMUs are created by compiling Modelica models with JModelica.org,
      or any other tool supporting FMU export. JModelica.org supports both
      export of FMUs for Model Exchange (FMU-ME) and export of FMUs for
      Co-Simulation (FMU-CS). The generated FMU can be loaded in an
      <literal>FMUModel(ME/CS)1</literal> object in Python and then be used
      for simulation purposes. Optimica models can not be compiled into
      FMUs.</para>

      <para>JMUs are created by compiling Modelica or Optimica models with
      JModelica.org. The JMU can then be loaded in a
      <literal>JMUModel</literal> object in Python and used for optimization
      purposes.</para>

      <para>FMUXes are created by compiling Modelica or Optimica models with
      JModelica.org. The FMUX main content is an XML file which follows the
      FMI standard with some additional JModelica.org specific elements and an
      equation section in which all equations used in the model are
      represented. The FMUX can be loaded in a <literal>CasadiModel</literal>
      object in Python and thereby use the automatic differentiation tool
      CasADi for optimization purposes. Read more about CasADi and how a
      <literal>CasadiModel</literal> object can be used for optimization in

    <title>Compilation</title>

    <para>This section brings up how to compile a model to an FMU-ME / FMU-CS,
    JMU or FMUX. Compiling a model to an FMU-ME / FMU-CS will be demonstrated
    in <xref linkend="models_sec_simple_fmume_compilation"/> and <xref
    linkend="models_sec_simple_fmucs_compilation"/> respectively, compiling to
    a JMU in <xref linkend="models_sec_simple_jmu_compilation"/> and compiling
    to FMUX in <xref linkend="models_sec_simple_fmux_compilation"/>.</para>

    <para>For more advanced usage of the compiler functions, there are
    compiler options and parameters which can be modified. These will be
    explained in <xref linkend="models_sec_compiler_settings"/>.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="models_sec_compilation_in_more_detail"/>, will go
    through some parts of the compilation process and how to perform these
    steps one by one.</para>

    <section xml:id="models_sec_simple_fmume_compilation">
      <title>Simple FMU-ME compilation example</title>

      <para>The following steps compiles a model to an FMU-ME:<procedure>
          <step>
            <para>Import the JModelica.org compiler function
            <literal>compile_fmu</literal> from the package
            <literal>pymodelica</literal>.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Specify the model and model file.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Perform the compilation.</para>
          </step>
        </procedure></para>

      <para>This is demonstrated in the following code example:<programlisting
      language="python"># Import the compiler function
from pymodelica import compile_fmu

# Specify Modelica model and model file (.mo or .mop)
model_name = 'myPackage.myModel'
mo_file = 'myModelFile.mo'

# Compile the model and save the return argument, which is the file name of the FMU
my_fmu = compile_fmu(model_name, mo_file)
</programlisting></para>

      <para>There is a compiler parameter: <literal>target</literal> which
      controls whether the model will be exported as an FMU-ME or FMU-CS. The
      default is to compile an FMU-ME, so <literal>target</literal> must not
      be set in this example.</para>

      <para>Once compilation has completed successfully, an FMU-ME will have
      been created on the file system. The FMU is essentially a compressed
      file archive containing the files created during compilation that are
      needed when instantiating a model object. Return argument for
      <literal>compile_fmu</literal> is the full file path of the FMU that has
      just been created, this will be useful later when we want to create
      model objects. More about the FMU and loading models can be found in
      <xref linkend="models_sec_loading_models"/>.</para>

      <para>In the above example, the model is compiled using default
      arguments and compiler options - the only arguments set are the model
      class and file name. However, <literal>compile_fmu</literal> has several
      other named parameters which can be modified. The different parameters,
      their default values and interpretation will be explained in <xref
      linkend="models_sec_compiler_settings"/>.</para>

    <section xml:id="models_sec_simple_fmucs_compilation">
      <title>Simple FMU-CS compilation example</title>

      <para>The following steps compiles a model to an FMU-CS:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Import the JModelica.org compiler function
          <literal>compile_fmu</literal> from the package

          <para>Perform the compilation.</para>
        </step>

      <para>This is demonstrated in the following code example:<programlisting

# Compile the model and save the return argument, which is the file name of the FMU
my_fmu = compile_fmu(model_name, mo_file, target='cs')
</programlisting></para>

      <para>In a Co-Simulation FMU, the integrator for solving the system is
      contained in the model. With an FMU-CS exported with JModelica.org, two
      different solvers are supported: CVode and Explicit Euler.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="models_sec_simple_jmu_compilation">
      <title>Simple JMU compilation example</title>

      <para>The steps required to compile a model to a JMU is very similar to
      compiling a model to an FMU:<procedure>
          <step>
            <para>Import the JModelica.org compiler function
            <literal>compile_jmu</literal> from the package

          <step>
            <para>Perform the compilation</para>
          </step>
        </procedure></para>

      <para>The only difference is really the requirement on the model, the
      FMU must be a pure Modelica model whilst a JMU can also be an Optimica
      model. The following code example demonstrates how to compile an
      JMU.<programlisting language="python"># Import the compiler function
from pymodelica import compile_jmu

# Specify Modelica or Optimica model and model file (.mo or .mop)
model_name = 'myPackage.myModel'
mo_file = 'myModelFile.mo'

# Compile the model and save the return argument, which is the file name of the FMU
my_jmu = compile_jmu(model_name, mo_file)
</programlisting></para>

      <para>As in the FMU case, when the compilation has completed
      successfully a JMU file will have been created on the file system. The
      return argument is also the full file path of the JMU that has just been
      created, which will be useful later when we want to create model
      objects. More about the JMU file and loading models can be found in
      <xref linkend="models_sec_loading_models"/>.</para>

    <section xml:id="models_sec_simple_fmux_compilation">

      <para>Compiling an FMUX follows the same principle as compiling an FMU
      and a JMU.</para>

        <step>
          <para>Import the JModelica.org compiler function

    <section>
      <title>Compiling from libraries</title>

      <para>The model to be compiled might not be in a loose '.mo' file, but
      rather part of a library consisting of a directory structure containing
      several Modelica files. In this case, the file within the library that
      contains the model should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be given on the
      command line. Instead, the entire library should to added to the list of
      libraries the compiler searches for classes in. This can be done in
      several ways (here <emphasis>library directory</emphasis> refers to the
      top directory of the library, that should have the same name as the top
      package in the library):</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Adding the directory containing the library directory to the
          environment variable <code>MODELICAPATH</code>. The compiler will
          search for classes in all libraries found in any on the directories
          in <code>MODELICAPATH</code>. In this case the
          <code>file_name</code> argument of the compilation function can be
          omitted, assuming no additional Modelica files are needed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Setting the <code>'extra_lib_dirs'</code> compiler option to
          the path to the directory containing the library directory. This is
          equivalent to adding it to the <code>MODELICAPATH</code>, but only
          for that compilation.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Giving the path to the library directory in the
          <code>file_name</code> argument of the compilation function. This
          allows adding a specific library to the search list (as opposed to
          adding all libraries in a specific directory).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>By default, the script starting a JModelica.org Python shell sets
      the <code>MODELICAPATH</code> to the directory containing the version of
      the Modelica Standard Library (MSL) that is included in the
      installation. Thus, all classes in the MSL are available without any
      need to specify its location.</para>

      <para>The Python code example below demonstrates these methods:</para>

      <programlisting># Import the compiler function
from pymodelica import compile_fmu

# Compile an example model from the MSL
fmu1 = compile_fmu('Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Examples.First')

# Compile a model from the library MyLibrary, located in C:\MyLibs
fmu2 = compile_fmu('MyLibrary.MyModel', compiler_options = {'extra_lib_dirs':'C:\MyLibs'})

# The same as the last command, if no other libraries in C:\MyLibs are needed
fmu3 = compile_fmu('MyLibrary.MyModel', 'C:\MyLibs\MyLibrary')

      corresponding Python <emphasis>docstring</emphasis> which is visualized
      with the interactive help. This is demonstrated for
      <literal>compile_fmu</literal> below. The parameters for

Help on function compile_fmu in module pymodelica.compiler:

compile_fmu(class_name, file_name=[], compiler='auto', target='me', version='1.0', 
            compiler_options={}, compile_to='.', compiler_log_level='warning', 
            separate_process=False, jvm_args='')
    Compile a Modelica model to an FMU.

    A model class name must be passed, all other arguments have default values.
    The different scenarios are:

    * Only class_name is passed:
        - Class is assumed to be in MODELICAPATH.

    * class_name and file_name is passed:
        - file_name can be a single path as a string or a list of paths
          (strings). The paths can be file or library paths.
        - Default compiler setting is 'auto' which means that the appropriate
          compiler will be selected based on model file ending, i.e.
          ModelicaCompiler if a .mo file and OptimicaCompiler if a .mop file is
          found in file_name list.

    Library directories can be added to MODELICAPATH by listing them in a
    special compiler option 'extra_lib_dirs', for example:

        compiler_options =
            {'extra_lib_dirs':['c:\MyLibs1','c:\MyLibs2']}

    Other options for the compiler should also be listed in the compiler_options
    dict.

    The compiler target is 'me' by default which means that the shared
    file contains the FMI for Model Exchange API. Setting this parameter to
    'cs' will generate an FMU containing the FMI for Co-Simulation API.

    Parameters::

        class_name --
            The name of the model class.

        file_name --
            A path (string) or paths (list of strings) to model files and/or
            libraries.
            Default: Empty list.

        compiler --
            The compiler used to compile the model. The different options are:
              - 'auto': the compiler is selected automatically depending on
                 file ending
              - 'modelica': the ModelicaCompiler is used
              - 'optimica': the OptimicaCompiler is used
            Default: 'auto'

        target --
            Compiler target. Possible values are 'me', 'cs' or 'me+cs'.
            Default: 'me'

        version --
            The FMI version. Valid options are '1.0' and '2.0'.
            Default: '1.0'
            Note: Must currently be set to '1.0'.

        compiler_options --
            Options for the compiler.
            Default: Empty dict.

        compile_to --
            Specify target file or directory. If file, any intermediate directories
            will be created if they don't exist. If directory, the path given must exist.
            Default: Current directory.

        compiler_log_level --
            Set the logging for the compiler. Takes a comma separated list with
            log outputs. Log outputs start with a flag :'warning'/'w',
            'error'/'e', 'info'/'i' or 'debug'/'d'. The log can be written to file
            by appended flag with a colon and file name.
            Default: 'warning'

        separate_process --
            Run the compilation of the model in a separate process.
            Checks the environment variables (in this order):
                1. SEPARATE_PROCESS_JVM
                2. JAVA_HOME
            to locate the Java installation to use.
            For example (on Windows) this could be:
                SEPARATE_PROCESS_JVM = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_37
            Default: False

        jvm_args --
            String of arguments to be passed to the JVM when compiling in a
            separate process.
            Default: Empty string

    Returns::

        A compilation result, represents the name of the FMU which has been
        created and a list of warnings that was raised.

      <title>Compile in separate process</title>

      <para>In JModelica.org, the compilers
      (<literal>ModelicaCompiler</literal> and
      <literal>OptimicaCompiler</literal>) are written in Java. To compile a
      model from the Python interface, with e.g.
      <literal>compile_fmu</literal>, the Python package
      <emphasis>JPype</emphasis> is used to access the compilers from Python
      (this is the default behavior).</para>

      <para>Another option is to compile the model in a separate process, that
      is not via JPype. This means that a specific JRE (Java Runtime
      Environment) can be used for the compilation. For those on a 64 bit
      Windows this is can be very useful as the default JRE used with JPype is
      32 bit. Also, in most cases, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can be given
      a larger heap space (especially when using a 64 bit JRE instead of a 32
      bit) which enables compilation of larger models.</para>

      <para>Set the environment variable
      <literal>SEPARATE_PROCESS_JVM</literal> to point at a specific Java
      installation (JRE or JDK) for the compilation. For Windows users, the
      environment variable can be found (and set) in the file
      <filename>setenv.bat</filename> which is located in the JModelica.org
      installation folder. It can also be set locally in the Python shell. If
      <literal>SEPARATE_PROCESS_JVM</literal> is not set,
      <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal> will be used instead. It is also possible
      to pass arguments to the JVM with the <literal>compile_fmu</literal>
      parameter '<literal>jvm_args</literal>'.</para>

      <para>The following example demonstrates how to compile an FMU in a
      separate process, setting the maximum heap space for the JVM to one
      gigabyte:<programlisting># Import the compiler function
from pymodelica import compile_fmu

        which can be used to generate C and XML code. If there are errors in
        the model, for example syntax or type errors, Python exceptions will
        be thrown during these steps.</para>

        <para>Note that the default setting for the compiler is to compile an
        FMU. So, to compile a JMU or an FMUX in this way, a few compiler
        options need to be set manually.</para>

    browser or logs in XML format from the non-linear solver.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Compiler logging</title>

      <para>The amount of logging that should be output by the compiler can be
      set with the argument <literal>compiler_log_level</literal> to the
      compile-functions (<literal>compile_fmu</literal>,
      <literal>compile_jmu</literal> and <literal>compile_fmux</literal>). The
      available log levels are <literal>'warning'</literal> (default),
      <literal>'error'</literal>, <literal>'info'</literal> and
      <literal>'debug'</literal> which can also be written as
      <literal>'w'</literal>, <literal>'e'</literal>, <literal>'i'</literal>
      and <literal>'d'</literal> respectively. The following example
      demonstrates setting the log level to <literal>'info'</literal>:</para>

      <para><programlisting># Set compiler log level to 'info'
compile_fmu('myModel', 'myModels.mo', compiler_log_level='info')
</programlisting>The log is printed to the standard output, normally the
      terminal window from which the compiler is invoked.</para>

      <para>The log can also be written to file by appending the log level
      flag with a colon and file name. This is shown in the following
      example:</para>

      <para><programlisting># Set compiler log level to info and write the log to a file log.txt

      <section>
        <title>Setting log level</title>

        <para>Many events that occur inside of an FMU can generate log
        messages. The log messages from the runtime are saved in a file with
        the default name <filename>&lt;FMU name&gt;_log.txt</filename>. A log
        file name can also be supplied when loading an FMU, this is shown in
        the example below:</para>

        <programlisting># Load model
model = load_fmu(fmu_name, log_file_name='MyLog.txt')
</programlisting>

        <para>How much information that is output to the log file can be
        controlled by setting the <literal>log_level</literal> argument to
        <literal>load_fmu</literal>. <literal>log_level</literal> can be any
        number between 0 and 7, where 0 means no logging and 7 means the most
        verbose logging. The log level can also be changed after the FMU has
        been loaded with the function <literal>set_log_level(level)</literal>.
        Setting the <literal>log_level</literal> is demonstrated in the
        following example:</para>

        <programlisting># Load model and set log level to 5
model = load_fmu(fmu_name, log_level=5)

# Change log level to 7
model.set_log_level(7)</programlisting>

        <para>If the loaded FMU is an FMU exported by JModelica.org, the
        amount of logging produced by the FMU can also be altered. This is
        done by setting the parameter <literal>_log_level</literal> in the
        FMU. This log level ranges from 0 to 6 where 0 represents the least
        verbose logging and 6 the most verbose. The following example
        demonstrates this:</para>

        <programlisting># Load model (with default log level)
model = load_fmu(fmu_name)

# Set amount of logging produced to the most verbose
model.set('_log_level', 6)

# Change log level to 7 to be able to see everything that is being produced
model.set_log_level(7)</programlisting>

      <title>Getting HTML diagnostics</title>

      <para>By setting the compiler option
      <literal>generate_html_diagnostics</literal> to true, a number of HTML
      pages containing similar diagnostics is generated. The HTML files are
      generated in the directory <literal>Model_Name_diagnostics</literal>,
      where <literal>Model_Name</literal> is the name of the compiled model.
      As compared to the diagnostics generated by the
      <literal>compiler_log_level</literal> argument, the HTML diagnostics
      contains only the most important information, but it also provides a
      better overview. Opening the file
      <literal>Model_Name_diagnostics/index.html</literal> in a web browser,
      results in a page similar to the one shown below.</para>
